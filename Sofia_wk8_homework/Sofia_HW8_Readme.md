Sofia Week 8 Code Homework

This week, my project is using donut chart to show nutrition facts of a donut. 
The data is created randomly by myself since my goal is to make a donut chart with tooltip.


The data is attached below.(The csv file will also be uploaded separately)

Fat	    20
Carbs	30
Fiber	40
Protein	10
