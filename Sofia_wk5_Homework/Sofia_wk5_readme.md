This is the readme of week 5

I imported a file with weekdays strings from "monday" to "sunday". 

Then I got the outcoem as the screenshot.

Though during the progress, I tried to imported a file with numbers and generate a sequential file.

I fail after several attemps, i didn't get any error messages but just nothing came out. 

Therefore, I chose to create a file only with strings which makes the job easier. 

I'm still trying to figure out how to import file with numbers and make it work. I will upload it to my github after I get it figured.
